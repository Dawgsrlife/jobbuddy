## 🏆 Hackathon Pitch (60 seconds)

*"Job searching is broken. Students spend hours applying through job portals, only to have their resumes disappear into ATS black holes. JobBuddy fixes this by skipping the portals entirely.*

*You pick your dream companies - Google, Stripe, OpenAI - and JobBuddy monitors their job postings 24/7. When a relevant role appears, it finds the hiring manager's email and sends a personalized, professional message on your behalf.*

*This isn't spam - it's strategic outreach. Our AI crafts unique emails that reference the specific role and highlight your relevant experience. The result? 3x higher response rates and direct conversations with decision-makers.*

*JobBuddy is your personal outbound job agent, working while you sleep to land your dream job."*
